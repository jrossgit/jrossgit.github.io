Sunday bus services: eurgh. The day started far too early, catching a train from Vienna to Eisenstadt. It turned out the only way to get to the park for opening would be to get a bus to the park at 9am, with rides opening at 10am. Dumped my bags in a locker at the main station (€2 - good value for station lockers), hopped aboard and enjoyed a scenic and relaxed journey in a mostly empty train.

*The Neusiedlersee area is an understated kind of pretty*

After realising we were on the same bus, I met up with Tilen, and we wandered around the park for the hour before the rides opened.

*Super whimsical joy*

*There's something very pleasing about how round this tree is*

*Continuing the theme of fiberglass pigs from Prater, this one dispenses ice cream*

We grabbed a quick ride on the slides, because they were there

Soon enough, the others turned up and we spent the day slowly sauntering around the park. A great asset that the park has in its favour is how interactive and explorable it is. For example, it's got some of those mechanical water toy areas.

Nearby is a dragon cave, where you can experience being sneezed on by a mythical creature

*So this is where Pete's Dragon ended up after Disney*

*Kanonen to Familypark: you heard it here first!*

Some people did the kiddie log flume. And when I say some people, I mean I did the kiddie log flume

*I say the non-riders missed out on a well themed masterpiece*

Familypark has two creds. Götterblitz is your standard family sit-down, but it's a high quality family sit-down, with some good scenery, and a comfortable ride.

More interactive stuff that us goons love:

*Bloody enthusiasts stealing the kids' play areas*

*Owain realises he's slightly too tall to relax on this hammock*

*Familypark understands the reality of babies (changing area sign)*

The left back of the park contains the uniquely well themed flats (and a faux-Dippin Dots stall that was popular amongst the goons). For example, here's a Sky Fly themed to a da Vinci flying machine.

*I'm really getting the hang of spinning these, which is bad for nausea*

And here's a controlled tower ride, themed to a Maypole.

*Bushes in queues make everything better*

The group worked its way back over to the other side of the park for the other cred. I sat out the slides, since they'd been done.

*Funny how the race order matches up with the order of how relaxed each person is*

*The slide also has goats. You can spend money to buy goat food*

*Unfortunately, to buy food token, you must make it past the guard wasp*

The second cred, Rattenmühle (Rat Mill), is a Gerstlauer Bobsled.

![](http://i.imgur.com/wUVw4pC.jpg)
*This artwork is fab!*

It's not my favourite of the bobsleds, but it's smooth and bouncy. Perfect for a family park like Familypark.

Some people went round for a reride, but not before somebody found a tunnel to crawl through by the exit. It's the little things that make this park.

*Tilen looks like that kid embarrassed by his dorky parents*

And, apart from a few animals, that's most of the park. It's got a sizeable range of kiddie rides, which of course, none of us had any part in riding.

*He's not with us*

*I do not know who this is*

In true European tradition, Familypark also has a fairytale forest. Unfortunately, I've been to Efteling, and every other place I've visited looks cheap and nasty in comparison.

![](http://i.imgur.com/cGPJjkn.jpg)
*I could research European fairytales to find out what's going on here, or leave it with no context*

![](http://i.imgur.com/ai9ZlMj.jpg)
*I honestly don't know what's gone on here. Nor would I like to find out*

![](http://i.imgur.com/mjhuil0.jpg)
*Oh god, he's looking at me, act natural*

Just one other sizeable ride on the way out: a leaning mini drop tower. Pleasantly airtime filled.

And that's Familypark. Quick stop off at the Butterfly on the way out...

*Whoosh (I don't count these)*

We made an early exit around 3pm, not having any reason to stick around. I needed to make my way over to a midpoint stopover at Linz, about halway between Vienna and Munich.

A strange observation in Linz: most places were shut, because Sundays and Austria. However, I did find two places where you could buy ice cream at 8pm in April. Not sure how much there was here. I was just here for a bed.

Back to regularly scheduled solo traveling next: staying in Munich for two nights and ticking off some local parks.
