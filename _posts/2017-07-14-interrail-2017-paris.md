Just one final push to finish the trip off. At this point, homesickness and exhaustion was beginning to set in, but I soldiered on regardless. There were a couple of hours to kill before my train to Paris, so went for an aimless wander around Cologne.

*Hey again*

It turns out there's not a huge amount of things to see in Cologne. It's a shame but getting bombed out in the war will do that. At least the cathedral was left alone, which, after leaving it for a week or two, is safely still there. There is a building with an ice cream on it though.

Yep, that's a building with ice cream on it

In addition, AfD was in town, Germany's far right political party. Police with guns seemed to be stacked on half the corners ready for any protests. Back to Cologne Central, for a Thalys service to Paris.

*Le train à Paris*

Not wild about these trains. Though they are more of the super-fast kind, they have a little bit of a cramped feeling to them. I was now in France.

Dropping things in my hotel, plans became aimless again, so I just set off to walk around and look at things because that's what I do in cities apparently. Soon enough found a couple of things worth looking at.

*No, I didn't buy tickets*

*There was some election going on at the time. And a play about Jesus*

*There was a guy with a guitar singing to the crowd too*

I pondered taking some photos in the Sacré Cœur for a second but there seemed to be a large number of people there for its intended purpose, so I left quietly. Trust me, it's gorgeous inside though.

*Here's where you come for some great views, except the Eiffel Tower, which you can't see from here*

I gave myself a lazy morning in, only going back to Gare du Nord to drop my heavy bag off. Through the Métro to Les Sablons, the local station for Jardin d'Acclimatations. I grabbed some lunch from a nearby market and wandered in.

Le Jardin is more of a city park with a scattered selection of attractions: fairground rides, zoo enclosures and playgrounds. The two coasters are hardly worth talking about (there are three coasters but one was SBNO). There's a Wild Mouse that left no impression on me at all, and a mine-train kind of thing. Neither particularly exciting.

It's the sort of place that's more of a pleasant place to be more than anything. Though there's a hint of sad animals with some smaller enclosures. A bizarre situation unfolded when I realised there was a peacock inside an enclosure, being watched by one outside.

*I don't think this is how zoos are supposed to work*

Next to the park is the impressive Louis Vuitton Design Museum. I'm not a big fan of fashion (as anybody with eyes would be able to tell), but I like extravagant modern architecture.

Pacing round, more animals and scenery

*Time to leave*

Scurrying away, more time to wander and look at things. Without much inspiration (or phone battery), I opted for the "look at touristy things" approach. One thing I do like is massive things (fnar) - such as one of the massive things at the end of the road upon which Jardin lies.

And let's not forget the other large thing in Paris.

*Rabbits on the side just... chilling*

Mostly this was just killing time, so back to Gare du Nord I went, checking in and saying goodbye to the continent. It's been a journey and I've got a load of stuff on my list of things to try and revisit in the future. Thanks to everyone for reading, and anybody that gave me tips and advice for the trip.
