Short report today. Sunday started on a very early train out of Rotterdam to Brussels. While we're at it, Rotterdam's ridiculous modern architecture extends to its station. I love it.

*Centraaaaaal*

Thalys do the international services to Belgium and France, and I managed to nab a "comfort" class ticket while they were still cheap

*This is in Brussels south station. The more you look, the more it gets worse*

Sightseeing in Brussels has never been high on my tourism list, but I did feel like checking out the Atomium to say I'd "done it" (and because science or something). Plus, another opportunity to tick off another metro cred.

*Metro cred! Brussels has a lot of stations with their own characteristic, which I'm always a fan of*

Main tourist spots covered, so was time to...

I moved onwards to the main order of the day - Bruges. My only regret is that I haven't watched the movie "In Bruges", so there's a ton of jokes I can't make.



My opinion of Bruges might be tinged by the fact that I was mildly sleep deprived (another snorer arrived in the hostel, yay) and doing constant walking with a rucksack. It's definitely pretty and has a huge range of traditional, historic architecture. For example...

*Quiet sidestreets is more my style*

*Jan van Eyck - he's the guy who painted pictures where all the women look like Putin*

But the more you walk around, the more it feels like the whole place only exists for tourists. Like, I know people live here. Lots of people. But the crowds overwhelm, and every shop starts to look like some kind of tourist trap. I dunno, it's a good place, but maybe I'd need to visit in the off season for a better result.

That said, since I *was** a tourist, I took the opportunity to have a sit down and regain some kind of plan by taking a boat tour.

*This guy has to give a live tour in three different languages*

So, at this point, I'd tired myself out and wanted to head home... but suddenly I spotted a booster in the distance. Upon further inspection: CREDS!

*Naff travelling mouse cred, but a +1 is a +1*

Yep, turns out a fair rocked up just as I was travelling through. Some people might know of Bedouijn Sea Park which has a +1 near the centre of Bruges, but I wasn't up for walking out to, then paying twenty euros for a single roller coaster and sad dolphins. But the metaphorical light switched back on when I saw the coasters. Screw history, this is what I'm here for. The other one was a tiny kiddie cred, and shame be damned, that thing was mine.

So yeah, on a better day, I might be more charitable about Bruges. It's a very picturesque place and I'd recommend it if it's your kind of thing but I have a low tolerance for places with lots of tourists (Cambridge probably did it in for me).

I stopped the night over in Ostend, on the Belgian coast.

*This beach could be anywhere, but it was taken at Ostend, on the Belgian coast*

 Not much to say about Ostend, except it exists and is probably busier as a beach destination in summer. The Belgian hostel chain "Jeugdherberg" has a site here, and if you're here in the low season, it's worth booking a dorm, as I got a four-bed dorm all to myself. Winning!

Next report: we find new entries in the top 20.
