If you're looking at this blog post at publication, it looks incredibly
basic. How could something this mundane be published as a first personal project
to the internet?

*Let's talk about perfectionism.*

Having high standards should be the gold standard, right? Somebody pours hours of
graft into a flawless project that displays the absolute best of what you have to offer and
everybody stands up and applauds ~~and that man's name, Albert Einstein~~.
As the old adage says, *'perfect is the enemy of good'*. Once the mind is set
on making something that is perfect, it's doomed to never complete. But worse, once something
is incomplete, it is categorised in the mind as a failure, in the "shame" part of the brain.
If you let that worry bury itself, the perfectionist approach to the next half finished
project will be ever stronger. "This one will be *perfect*!" ...and the cycle of
half finished project and failure continues.

This situation is where I find myself. If you find yourself here too, here's what to do:

**Decide what to make. Figure out how to make it. Then make it!**

The important part of these instructions is deciding what to make and sticking to it.
Whether a personal throwaway project
or something more substantial, "what to make" (the Minimum Viable Product) should not change until
it is complete, or until it has to. Fighting the urge to go *oh but what if* can be
difficult.

For this blog post, here's my checklist:

1. Can be read by other people on the internet
2. Teaches something about deploying a website
3. Doesn't look like garbage
4. Contains enough words to look like a real blog post

One tool that can be leveraged for getting past perfectionism is using somebody else's work!
This site uses a static site generator, [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), thus accomplishing
the above points:

1. Static sites are just plain files that are easy to publish and easy to understand
   for somebody with a basic understanding of HTML
2. I could easily set up an account on a blogging platform such as Medium, but all
   that teaches me is how to write. Using the most simple of deployment can provide a
   springboard for trying out more fun stuff later!
3. Generating a new site (by running `jekyll new its-my-blog`) includes default styles
   that looks reasonable (if boring) on most devices
4. Blog posts are written in markdown and converted to HTML behind the scenes,
   which makes it easy to concentrate on the content.

And that's how these words have appeared on your screen. Hopefully more will follow.

In summary, if you feel like everything you produce must be perfect, ask yourself
whether that desire is holding you back from completing what you *really* want. Find a goal,
decide how to get there, and just *Do It*!
