Another year, another trip report. I'd been craving a return to coasters for a while, so decided on a long weekend in April. The plan:

Day 1 - Efteling
Day 2 - Duinrell/Drievliet
Day 3 - Belgian tourism
Day 4 - Plopsaland

The plan was motivated by a few things. Firstly, as I occasionally mention, I like trains, and Eurostar just started running trains to The Netherlands. Off to St Pancras then...

![Sir John Betjeman is personally shocked that this report starts on a train](/assets/img/2018-05-20-benelux1-efteling/VXEGVYa.jpg)

Rotterdam acts as a nice base for doing The Netherlands, so I arrived around 10pm to go and find my hostel. Hostels can be hit and miss. Room Rotterdam wasn't bad in itself, but I got hampered with some roomies who wanted to barge in at 1am, and another who snored. A lot. When I run a hostel, snorers get discounts on private rooms.

![The Blijdorp room was also themed specifically to the Madagascar films and atrocious attempts at humour. "We can sleep in the Blijdorp room" - I have alternative opinions](/assets/img/2018-05-20-benelux1-efteling/vrnt64a.jpg)

Another motivation for my visit was Efteling. I've been to Efteling on the 2016 live and came away feeling luke-warm. What changed in the meantime was listening to the soundtracks on loop and oh my god I've fallen in love with them (let's just say there's a piano rendition of Flying Dutchman in progress).

Getting to Efteling is easy enough. Get a couple of short train hops to Tilburg, then a bus to Efteling.

Symbolica's pre-opening queue was tiny, so made my way in as the second single-rider of the day.

Oh boy, Symbolica! I don't know what part of me it opened up, but the first ride was magic! The music is perfect, the reveals are perfect (opening stairs, spinning into the panorama balcony), the sets are so detailed and immersive. I didn't get to use the interactive bits on the first try, but I was perfectly happy to sit back and take everything in. Favourite dark ride at Efteling, hands down!

Rather than throw myself at the thrill rides, I looped around hoovering up some of the gentler options first. Droomvlucht still has some great scenes, and the music elevates it considerably. Unfortunately, I'd just ridden Symbolica. I didn't get the "whoa" factor with the planets scene like last time.

Villa Volta: still great! Still don't understand Dutch! Still prefer Hex (but only just)

![Always thought the Rok looked a little bemused/suspicious](/assets/img/2018-05-20-benelux1-efteling/N3ZL0Oi.jpg)

Vogel Rok next. Knowing the music actually gives and takes a little. On the one hand, the swoopiness with the wind rushing past pairs well with internally screaming "Dah, da DAAAA," but on the other hand, I never realised how badly synced the music is. You're practically on the brake run when the exciting bit fires up. Ticked off Carnival Festival too, because I needed a laugh. Christ, the buckteeth.

![The vintage cars are moderately fun too. Don't film and drive, kids](/assets/img/2018-05-20-benelux1-efteling/lgnCGF8.jpg)

Thrill stuff now! First option: Flying Dutchman. It broke down.

![SPITE!](/assets/img/2018-05-20-benelux1-efteling/wnYIbe9.jpg)

Second option: Baron 1898 where I remembered how good the pre-show, the music and all that was. And then the coaster is just ok.

Quick blast over to Fata Morgana. I'm definitely doing the dark rides in reverse-order of goodness.

![Snaaakee eyeeeees](/assets/img/2018-05-20-benelux1-efteling/fs1XfTS.jpg)

I'd also recommend the indoor steam carousel, with proper fairground organ to boot.

![Yeah, I went for the nerd shot](/assets/img/2018-05-20-benelux1-efteling/F4QQDlE.jpg)

Take two of Flying Dutchman was successful. Half hour queue (on a non-holiday weekday in April) but at least it's the best queue to wait in. I wouldn't shock anybody by saying the indoor bit is atmospheric and tense, and the outdoor bit is gross.

![My opinions are boring and predictable... just like the outdoor section](/assets/img/2018-05-20-benelux1-efteling/ysIw1uq.jpg)

Of the other coasters, Joris en de Draak is still pacey and fun, but not a stand out for me. Bob is still weirdly terrifying.

And finally, as the day was drawing to a close, Python's queue was vanishing. Holy crap, you actually can polish a turd. Congratulations to whoever thought this idea, Python is now... OK. It's fine.

![You're fine, this is fine](/assets/img/2018-05-20-benelux1-efteling/tVmTIu1.jpg)

A few rerides of various things later, and that's the day! So, Efteling somehow leapt from lukewarm-decent to ERMAGERD I LOVE IT in two years. The day was mostly without its problems, except for that part where Flying Dutchman broke down, and also that the Stroopwafel hut was closed.

Episode two next, in which too many coasters are brown.
