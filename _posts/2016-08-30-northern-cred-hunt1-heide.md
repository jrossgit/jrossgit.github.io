A while back, the CoasterForce announced some meetup dates for Sweden and having the resources to do so, I started looking around for things to build onto them. Most of the group going to Kolmården decided to do Liseberg and Gröna Lund, but I started noticing other places I could get to easily by train. Resisting the urge to bankrupt myself, I managed to get a week long break starting in Hamburg and going up to Sweden via Copenhagen:

- Sunday - Fly in, Hamburg Sommardom
- Monday - Heide Park
- Tuesday - Hansa-Park
- Wednesday - Tivoli/Bakken
- Thursday - Doing tourism in Copenhagen
- Friday - Join the others in Sweden

After managing to pack ten day's worth of clothing into hand-luggage (I didn't realise how generous it was) I boarded an Easyjet flight to **Hamburg** (which of course was delayed) and dumped my bags at the hostel.

### Sunday - Hamburg Sommardom

About a week before the trip, I found out Hamburg Sommardom was in town. This means...

*Surprise Teststrecke :D*

Teststrecke is the typical Schwarzkopf - smooth and forceful. There's something exhilirating to diving through the support structure at night. And at €4 a ride, it's easily the best value ride at the fair.

Also at the fair was the surprisingly pleasant Wilde Maus and a vile Pinfari whose wheels sounded like they were threatening to explode at any moment (both €5).

There's something really vibrant about German fairs. You've still got the obnoxious shouting everywhere and a level of seediness, but there's a sense of ambition and scale that I've not seen in the UK. It's an endless bombardment of colour and sound.

But enough of that fair rubbish. Onto the good stuff.

<h3>Monday - Heide park</h3>

The first of many early starts to come (such is the life of the enthusiast) - up Monday morning to get a train from Hamburg Hauptbahnhof, conveniently located a couple of minutes walk from the hostel.

*So majestic*

The two main Hamburg parks are easy to do by train. Heide is a short hop to Buchholz, then a change onto a train to Wolterdingen, which takes a lovely scenic route through some forests...

*Pictured: said forests (Wolterdingen)*

...followed by a walk through more forests to the park.

*This sign says "Creds ahead!"*

I arrived early to the park, waiting with the hordes behind the Heide Park gate, so took the opportunity to take some pictures of the forecourt, which, like most German parks, is very traditionally German.

*Rather lovely*

Come ten o'clock, a big booming countdown started counting down to the park opening, smoke filling the forecourt. "Vier, drei, zwei, eins," the gate opens and the hordes pour in. I follow towards cred #1.

*Krake*

I've had my negative remarks about Shiekra, the only extended Dive Machine I'd done, but this packed a punch. The solid drop, snappy dive loop and forceful airtime hill go over well. Very short, but at least it doesn't outstay its welcome. Flug was a trek up a large hill, so I moved swiftly next door to cred #2 (Vekoma of blah), and cred #3 (Vekoma of Death)

*Big Loop is photogenic*

*So photogenic*

*Also photogenic but unfortunately an SLC*

Big Loop is surprisingly buttery smooth until it hits the MCBR, at which point it remembers that it's a Vekoma. Limit doesn't mess around, preferring to just get on with the pain. Onwards up the hill. I love the little corners of the park like this dead end loop under Bobbahn. Nothing here, just a good photo opportunity for the coaster

![](http://i.imgur.com/aAVeEju.jpg)
*Gorgeous*

The ride itself is a bit rattly but long and forceful, with lots of tunnels and scenery interaction. Just the way I like it. The whole setting on the hill with Flug flying around below the castle makes for a great backdrop to the park. The whole place is naturally picturesque, with lakesides, lots of green and some glorious architecture.

*Sexy*

Onto Flug, which had a 45 minute wait by this point. This ride sells wingriders as a concept far more than Swarm. I love the little turnaround up by the castle and the airtime hill followed by a dive under the bridge. It peters out a bit towards the end, but is still a solid ride.

*Hey look, Merlin does know how to theme a ride without shipping containers*

Lunch crept up, so I headed to the sit down restaurant near the entrance, where I bought Schnitzel (because Germany) and a rather tasty rhubarb soda. Heide wins park food highlight of the trip.

*The chips were cooked with bacon bits - I approve*

Three more available creds after lunch, but plenty of time remaining, so I had a quick look at the How to Train Your Dragon area and the boat ride. Quite disappointing considering the effort that went into the area in general. You go into the cave which, of course is forbidden, and come out again.

*Dragon Grotto: Journey to the Forbidden Cave*

Next up Coloso... wait closed WHAT?

*SPITE*

Sad face. Let's move onto Desert Race. I love Rita, so I was expecting good things from her German sister. Not disappointed, it is almost exactly like Rita. Hurrah!

![](http://i.imgur.com/2xlSmKs.jpg)

The mine train was next door. It's a decent one, and well themed to boot. Finally, I stumped up the courage to queue for the kiddie cred. That was a mistake. I looked out for some spin 'n' spews while making my way back to Krake and Flug for rerides.

![](http://i.imgur.com/Pv8xW7L.jpg)
*Mmm, sickly*

The circus tent had a show on in ten minutes, so I took a break while a man with a ponytail drew some things in sand. Not quite what I was expecting

![](http://i.imgur.com/bbp9SkJ.jpg)
*The ponytail lets you know he is an **artiste** *

*"The adventure is in you": pseudo-inspirational bollocks transcends all languages*

There was enough time to nab rerides on Krake (front row!) and Flug on the way out.

There's an air of Merlin commercialism to Heide Park, but I think it's a great park, and had Colossos been open, maybe pushed for my favourite park. As it is, it's picturesque (aside from the odd bare section like near Desert Race) and has a good line-up of decent rides and other attractions. I wanted to dash back to Hamburg, so grabbed a kebab on the way out of the park.

### Miniatur Wunderland

With some time left over at the end of the day, I went over to Miniatur Wunderland. If you're ever in Hamburg, definitely set some time out for this. It's a massive model train set on steroids, with multi-storey mountain ranges, a working airport and trains and cars whizzing about all over the place. There's so much detail and so many little jokes and easter eggs, that you could spend hours here (like I did) and not get bored at all.

I couldn't do this place justice, so you're best looking at photos by actual photographers or just going yourself. I did get a shot of some creds though...

*Every fifteen or so minutes, the place transitions to night*

*The control room is open to view*

*Occasionally, something derails and a man appears, tip-toes through the city and fixes it*

All in all, a fantastic first day. Next up, we travel north to Hansa-Park
