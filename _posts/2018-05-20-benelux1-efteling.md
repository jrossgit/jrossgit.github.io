Another year, another trip report. I'd been craving a return to coasters for a while, so decided on a long weekend in April. The plan:

- Day 1 - Efteling
- Day 2 - Duinrell/Drievliet
- Day 3 - Belgian tourism
- Day 4 - Plopsaland

The plan was motivated by a few things. Firstly, as I occasionally mention, I like trains, and Eurostar just started running trains to The Netherlands. Off to St Pancras then...

*Sir John Betjeman is personally shocked that this report starts on a train*

Rotterdam acts as a convenient base for doing The Netherlands, so I arrived around 10pm to go and find my hostel. Hostels can be hit and miss. Room Rotterdam wasn't bad in itself, but I got hampered with some roomies who wanted to barge in at 1am, and another who snored. A lot. When I run a hostel, snorers get discounts on private rooms.

*The Blijdorp room was also themed specifically to the Madagascar films and atrocious attempts at humour. "We can sleep in the Blijdorp room" - I have alternative opinions*

Another motivation for my visit was Efteling. I've been to Efteling on the 2016 live and came away feeling luke-warm. What changed in the meantime was listening to the soundtracks on loop and my god, I've fallen in love with them.

Getting to Efteling is straightforward. It's a couple of short train hops to Tilburg, then a bus to Efteling.

*Efteling!*

Symbolica's pre-opening queue was tiny, so made my way in as the second single-rider of the day.

*Time to get excited!*

Oh boy, Symbolica! I don't know what part of me it opened up, but the first ride was magic! The music is perfect, the reveals are perfect and the sets are detailed and immersive. I didn't get to use the interactive bits on the first try, but I was perfectly happy to sit back and take everything in. Favourite dark ride at Efteling, hands down!

Rather than throw myself at the thrill rides, I looped around hoovering up some of the gentler options first. Droomvlucht still has some great scenes, and the music elevates it considerably. Unfortunately, I'd just ridden Symbolica. I didn't get the "whoa" factor with the planets scene like last time.

Villa Volta: still great! Still don't understand Dutch! Still prefer Hex (but only just)

*Always thought the Rok looked a little bemused/suspicious*

Vogel Rok next. Knowing the music in advance gives and takes a little. On the one hand, the swoopiness with the wind rushing past pairs well with internally screaming the tune.. "Dah, da DAAAA," but on the other hand, I never realised how badly synced the music is. You're practically on the brake run when the exciting part fires up. Ticked off Carnival Festival too, because I needed a laugh. Christ, the buckteeth.

*The vintage cars are moderately fun too. Don't film and drive, kids*

Thrill stuff now! First option: Flying Dutchman. It broke down.

*SPITE!*

Second option: Baron 1898 where I remembered how good the pre-show, the music and all that was. And then the coaster is just ok.

*It's OK*

*Ding Ding*

Quick blast over to Fata Morgana. I'm definitely doing the dark rides in reverse-order of goodness.

I'd also recommend the indoor steam carousel, with proper fairground organ to boot.

*Yeah, I went for the nerd shot*

Take two of Flying Dutchman was successful. Half hour queue (on a non-holiday weekday in April) but at least it's the best queue to wait in. I wouldn't shock anybody by saying the indoor bit is atmospheric and tense, and the outdoor bit is gross.

*My opinions are boring and predictable... just like the outdoor section*

*Kinda secret terrace bit*

Of the other coasters, Joris en de Draak is still pacey and fun, but not a stand out for me. Bob is still weirdly terrifying.

And finally, as the day was drawing to a close, Python's queue was vanishing. And it turns out, you actually can polish a turd. Congratulations to whoever thought this idea because Python is now... OK. It's fine.

*You're fine, this is fine*

A few rerides of various things later, and that's the day! So, Efteling somehow leapt from lukewarm-decent to ERMAGERD I LOVE IT in two years. The day was mostly without its problems, except for that part where Flying Dutchman broke down, and also that the Stroopwafel hut was closed.

*NOOOOO I want my stroopwafel!*

Episode two next, in which too many coasters are brown.
